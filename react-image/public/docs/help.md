## Getting Started

1. Upload an image using either:

## Basic Image Adjustments

Adjust fundamental image properties using the sliders:

- **Brightness** (-100 to +100): Adjust the overall lightness of the image
- **Contrast** (-100 to +100): Enhance or reduce the difference between light and dark areas
- **Saturation** (-100 to +100): Control the intensity of colors

Note: Shadows and Highlights adjustments are currently under development.

## Art Styles

Transform your image with artistic filters:

### Pointillism
- Creates a painting-like effect using small dots
- Inspired by the post-impressionist style
- Best for images with clear subjects and good contrast
- **Granularity**: Controls dot size and density
- **Randomness**: Affects dot placement and variation

### Cubism
- Breaks the image into geometric shapes
- Creates an abstract, angular interpretation
- Works well with architectural and structural images
- **Granularity**: Adjusts size of geometric segments
- **Randomness**: Varies shape distortion and angles

### Modern
- Applies a contemporary artistic interpretation
- Segments the image with bold lines and shapes
- Effective for both landscapes and portraits
- **Granularity**: Controls segment size
- **Randomness**: Affects color and shape variation

## Raster Effects

Add detailed texture patterns to your image:

### Dots
- Creates a halftone-like pattern using dots
- **Granularity** (0-100): Controls dot size and spacing
- **Randomness** (0-100): Adds variation to dot placement and size

### Horizontal Lines (H-Lines)
- Converts the image into horizontal line patterns
- **Granularity**: Affects line thickness and spacing
- **Randomness**: Varies line positions and intensity

### Vertical Lines (V-Lines)
- Similar to horizontal lines but in vertical orientation
- **Granularity**: Controls line spacing and thickness
- **Randomness**: Adds variation to line placement

## Image Metadata

Manage your image's information:

## Tips for Best Results

2. Use granularity and randomness to fine-tune effects
3. Combine different effects for unique results
4. Save metadata for proper image attribution
5. Preview changes before finalizing export
